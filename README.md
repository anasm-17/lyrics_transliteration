# lyrics_transliteration
### Working model not yet deployed, project is still under development

We believe that the inability to read a language in it's native form should not demotivate aspiring singers from learning songs in foreign languages. My team, a group of Master of Data Science students at UBC, would like to give singers the ability to sing songs in foreign languages by building a transliteration app using our data science and machine learning skills. For now, our goal is to make transliteration of song lyrics from their native form to a phonetic english form.
